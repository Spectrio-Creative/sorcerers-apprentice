For templating projects like telling brooms to fill buckets.


### Description
[The Sorcerer's Apprentice](https://legacy.spectrio.com/creative/tools/sorcerer-script/) is a script for Adobe After Effects designed to make templating (and using templates) easy. It provides rules for creating template compositions which can be filled as simply as filling out a form and attaching images.

### Installation
Installed like any other AE script; download the both the script and the UI Panel from the downloads page, then add the unzipped script file to your AE Scripts folder (`Applications⁩/Adobe After Effects <version>⁩/Scripts` on a mac and `Program Files\Adobe\Adobe After Effects <version>\Support Files\Scripts` on a windows) and the unziped UI Panel file to the ScriptUI Panels subfolder.

Once both the script and the UI Panel are installed, restart AE (if it’s open) and open the `Sorcerer’s Apprentice.jsx` from the bottom of the ‘Window’ menu. You can then doc the panel wherever works for you and run the script from young Mickey’s magic button.

Starting with version 2.3.0, you must also install the [Google “dwebp” CLI app](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/download). You can do so by Downloading it (either from [google](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/download) or it's included in this repo under 'dependencies') and placing it in the same folder as the main script file.

In order for the script to be able to troubleshoot problematic image files, you must give it permission to write files. You can do this my going to `Preferences > Scripting & Expressions` in After Effects and checking the “Allow Scripts to Write Files and Access Network” box.
