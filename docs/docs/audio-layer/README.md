## Visibility Tag

Image Subtag ‘v’ [`!Av`]

The visibility tag adds a checkbox to the menu field in the script which allows you to turn the layer on and off from the script. This is especially useful for adding options into your templates. For example, you might want to select between several pre-edited audio layer options.
